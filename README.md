An intuitive app for predicting diabetes based on health metrics like Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, etc. It uses various machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to provide predictions and performance insights.

**Features:**
- Real-time diabetes prediction
- Interactive user interface with animations
- Supports multiple machine learning models

### 2. **🌸 IrisWise - Iris Species Classification**

Predict the species of Iris flowers based on input features (sepal and petal dimensions) using K-Nearest Neighbors and other machine learning models.

**Features:**
- Real-time iris species prediction
- Dynamic visualizations and tooltips for enhanced user experience

### 3. **🎓 GradeCast - GPA Prediction Model**

Estimate GPA/CGPA based on student performance data, providing an accurate prediction of academic success. Built using regression models.

**Features:**
- Input academic scores to predict GPA
- Simple and user-friendly interface

### 4. **🧮 DigitSense - MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier**

Identify handwritten digits (0-9) with this accurate, real-time classifier powered by a CNN model.

**Features:**
- Recognizes digits from 0-9
